/**
 * Java variables typically fall into one of four primary scopes:
 * 
 * 1. Class Scope (Static Variables): 
 *    Declared with the static keyword inside a class but outside methods. 
 *    These are accessible to all instances of the class and can even be 
 *    accessed without creating an object.
 * 
 * 2. Instance Scope (Instance Variables): 
 *    Declared inside a class but without the static keyword. 
 *    These are tied to a specific object; each instance of the class 
 *    has its own copy.
 * 
 * 3. Method Scope (Local Variables): 
 *    Declared inside a method. They are only visible within that 
 *    specific method and cease to exist once the method finishes execution.
 * 
 * 4. Block Scope: 
 *    Variables declared inside any set of braces {} within a method, 
 *    such as in if statements or for loops. They are only accessible 
 *    within those specific braces.
